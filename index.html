      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      system enabling information to be shared over the Internet through
      simplified ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT "specialists" and
      hobbyists,[1] as well as documents and other web resources to be accessed
      over the Internet according to specific rules, the Hypertext Transfer
      Protocol (HTTP).[2] creating web pages and web applications. Web browsers
      receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
      them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
      semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
      document. <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%" />

      Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through
      web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers
      and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
      character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original
      and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext
      Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images,
      embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that
      implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports
      hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web
      resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of
      following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are
      web pages that function as application software. The information in the
      Web is transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer
      Protocol (HTTP).
