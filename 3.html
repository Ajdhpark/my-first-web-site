        ><strong>JavaScript</strong> (<u>JS</u>)</a
      >
      often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
      technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023,
      98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
      behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
      browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users'
      devices.

      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM).
